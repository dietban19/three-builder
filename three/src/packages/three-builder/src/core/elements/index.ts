/**
 * This library acts as the central controller for managing all elements within the application. It provides functions to create new elements, delete unnecessary ones, and access any element globally. Moreover, it ensures that elements that require updates are automatically refreshed, and it helps dispose of elements when no longer needed to prevent memory-related issues such as leaks.
